    "\n",
    "- Image Recognition : Image recognition is one of the most common applications of machine learning. It is used to identify objects, persons, places, digital images, etc. The popular use case of image recognition and face detection is Automatic friend tagging suggestion.\n",
    "- Speech Recognition : While using Google, we get an option of Search by voice, it comes under speech recognition, and it's a popular application of Machine Learning. Speech recognition is a process of converting voice instructions into text, and it is also known as Speech to text, or Computer based speech recognition At present, machine learning algorithms are widely used by various applications of speech recognition. Google assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are using speech recognition technology to follow the voice instructions.\n",
    "- Traffic prediction : It predicts the traffic conditions such as whether traffic is cleared, slow-moving, or heavily congested with the help of two ways: Real Time location of the vehicle form Google Map app and sensors Average time has taken on past days at the same time.\n",
    "- Product recommendations : Machine learning is widely used by various e-commerce and entertainment companies such as Amazon, Netflix, etc., for product recommendation to the user."
